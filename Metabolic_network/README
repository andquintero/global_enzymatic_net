Usage example:
./1_2_Fetch_EC_met.pl ../Data
./3_filter_reactions_slim.pl 40 ../Data/reactions_slim 
./4_network_constuction.pl ../Data/reactions_slim.filter_40
./5_adjacency_matrix.pl ../Results/network.reactions_slim.filter_40

Main scripts description:

1_2_Fetch_EC_met.pl = Reads enzyme information fron KEGG database and prints a file of enzymes and associated metabolites
	use= ./1_2_Fetch_EC_met.pl ../Data
	the output file (reactions_slim ) is printed in the folder Data
	
3_filter_reactions_slim.pl = counts metabolite frequency and discards the n most common, this helps to reduce the high connectivity present in this kind of networks
	use= ./3_filter_reactions_slim.pl NUMBER ../Data/reactions_slim 
	the output file (reactions_slim.filter_NUMBER) is printed in the folder Data

4_network_constuction.pl = find enzymes that shares a common metabolite and prints them by pairs	
	use= ./4_network_constuction.pl ../Data/reactions_slim.filter_NUMBER
