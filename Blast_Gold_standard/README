Usage example:
./1_Fetch_genes.pl ../../Metabolic_network/Results/eclist
./2_DataBase_network.pl ../Results/Blasted_genes.list ../../Metabolic_network/Results/network.reactions_slim.filter_40
./3_Gen-gen_adjacency_matrix.pl ../Results/Gen-Gen.nodot.list
./4_Weight_adjacency_matrix.pl ../Results/Gen-Gen.nodot.list ../Results/genes_in_adjacency_matrix.list ../../../GCN/S.csv ../../../GCN/gene_names21122.csv 

Main scripts description:

1_Fetch_genes.pl = use Kegg to download sequences associated to a EC number and make a blastp against DataBase
	use= ./1_Fetch_genes.pl ../../Metabolic_network/Results/eclist
	Edit line 62 according to database name and location in disk
	the output file (Blasted_genes.list) is printed in the folder Results

2_DataBase_network.pl =	use file generated by 1_Fetch_genes.pl and by 4_network_constuction.pl and prints genes related to other genes
	use= ./2_DataBase_network.pl ../Results/Blasted_genes.list ../../Metabolic_network/Results/network.reactions_slim.filter_NUMBER
	the output file (Gen-Gen.nodot.list) is printed in the folder Results	

3_Gen-gen_adjacency_matrix.pl = use file of gen pairs and makes an adjacency matrix using the list of blasted genes.
	use= ./3_Gen-gen_adjacency_matrix.pl ../Results/Gen-Gen.nodot.list

4_Weight_adjacency_matrix.pl = Assign a weight to each edge according to the similarity score between two genes in a previously computed similarity matrix
	this script require: 
		1. list of gen-gen relationships generated by 2_DataBase_network.pl
		2. ordered list of genes in Gen-Gen.nodot.list
			Note: this file is not created by any of the scripts provided, 
			one way to make this file is to start a terminal and change directory to the Metabolic_net_files/Blast_Gold_standard/Results directory 
			and run the following terminal commands:
				cut -f 1 Gen-Gen.nodot.list > ../Data/temp1
				cut -f 2 Gen-Gen.nodot.list > ../Data/temp2
				cat ../Data/temp* |sort|uniq > genes_in_adjacency_matrix.list
		3. similarity matrix
		4. ordered list of genes in similarity matrix
		Files 3 and 4 must be previously computed using other software (we advice using R and its multiple freely available libraries)
